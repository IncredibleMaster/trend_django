| **django-trench** provides a set of REST API endpoints to supplement `django-rest-framework`_ with multi-factor authentication (MFA, 2FA). It supports both standard built-in authentication methods, as well as JWT (JSON Web Token).

| We deliver a couple of sample secondary authentication methods including sending OTP based code by:

* E-mail
* SMS / text
* 3rd party mobile apps
* `YubiKey`_

| Developers can easily add their own authentication backends supporting any communication channel.

Features
********

* Easily pluggable and compatible with `django-rest-framework`_
* Allows user to pick an additional authentication method from range of backends defined by a developer. Read more: `backends`_
* Comes out of a box with email, SMS, mobile apps and YubiKey support
