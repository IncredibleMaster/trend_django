| **django-trench** provides a set of REST API endpoints to supplement `django-rest-framework`_ with multi-factor authentication (MFA, 2FA). It supports both standard built-in authentication methods, as well as JWT (JSON Web Token). **django-trench** follows the url pattern developed in `djoser`_ library and may act as its supplement.
| We deliver a couple of sample secondary authentication methods including sending OTP based code by email, SMS/text as well as through 3rd party mobile apps or utilising YubiKey. Developers can easily add own auth backend supporting any communication channel.

Features
--------

* Easily plugable and compatible with `django-rest-framework`_ and `djoser`_
* Allows user to pick an additional authentication method from range of backends defined by a developer. Read more: `backends`_
* Comes out of a box with email, SMS, mobile apps and YubiKey support
